# Dominion-Kingdom-Card-Picker
This is a personal project to create a Kingdom Card picker for the board game Dominion, as a way to practice my skills.

The goal of the project is to create a python script that will allow the user to save which Dominion sets they have available and
randomly select 10 Kingdom cards for use in a Dominion game from those sets. Users can use all available sets, choose which sets
they'd like the script to choose from for a particular game, or have the script randomly determine sets to use from those
available.

The repository includes a complete database of all usable Kingdom Cards, including effects, cost, name, and which set they are
from. Eventually, the picker will be able to perform more tasks for the user, such as selecting an additional Bane card for the
Young Witch, determine whether Colonies and Platinums from Prosperity will be used, etc. It will also be able to describe cards
that are not in the Kingdom Card deck, such as individual Knights and Ruins, and the Travelers from Adventures.

As of 3/15/16, basic functionality is complete. Users may specify which sets they have available, choose or randomly determine
sets to use from their collection, and have 10 cards randomly selected from those sets. Run picker.py to try the program!

Enjoy!
